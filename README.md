# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of the Analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis was to create a summary of the ride-sharing data for PyBer by city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural). During this analysis we also do a specific review for the time period of 01/01/2019 through 04/28/2019 and I created a multi-line chart to make it easier to visualize trends in each city type for that time period. 

## Results: 

Overall the fares made in Urban cities are much higher MoM compared to Suburban (2nd) and Rural (3rd). Since the demand for PyBer is higher in Urban areas and there are more drivers, the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver are both lower. 




## Summary:
