# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of the Analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis was to create a summary of the ride-sharing data for PyBer by city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural). During this analysis we also do a specific review for the time period of 01/01/2019 through 04/28/2019 and I created a multi-line chart to make it easier to visualize trends in each city type for that time period. 

## Results: 

Overall the fares made in Urban cities are much higher MoM compared to Suburban (2nd) and Rural (3rd). Since there are more drivers in Urban areas and more competition, the average fare per ride is lower. Also, since there are less drivers in both Rural and Suburban areas, the average fare per driver is much higher than it is in Urban areas.

For the review specific to 01/01/2019 - 04/28/2019, almost all the city types reached their peak just before March. For Rural fares, they hit their peak at the beginning of April (around $500.00 vs just under that before March). Urban areas also hit just above where they where late Feb., in early March and got close again early April.

## Summary: 

1. After this review I would suggest looking into lowering the number of drivers in Urban areas or find a way so that the drivers are able to make more. This is the only city type where the average fare per driver is less than the average fare per ride. 

2. After this review, it is also clear that there is the most potential in Urban areas for revenue, with Urban areas being $20,000.00 ahead in total fares of 2nd place (Suburban areas). They should keep this in mind when making moves towards growth in the future.  

3. I would also recommend using the month over month analysis to be strategic about advertising. I think this could also be taken a step further and have strategic advertisments at specific times, like pop ups in phone adds, when people use this service the most.
