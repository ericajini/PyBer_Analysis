# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of the Analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis was to create a summary of the ride-sharing data for PyBer by city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural). During this analysis we also do a specific review for the time period of 01/01/2019 through 04/28/2019 and I created a multi-line chart to make it easier to visualize trends in each city type for that time period. 

## Results: 

Overall the fares made in Urban cities are much higher MoM compared to Suburban (2nd) and Rural (3rd). Since there are more drivers in Urban areas and more competition, the average fare per ride is lower. Also, since there are less drivers in both Rural and Suburban areas, the average fare per driver is much higher than it is in Urban areas.

For the review specific to 01/01/2019 - 04/28/2019, almost all the city types reached their peak just before March. For Rural fares only, they hit their peak at the beginning of April (around $500.00 vs just under that before March). Urban areas also hit the same peak number again in early March and got close again early April.
